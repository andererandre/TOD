<p><b>You can expect a thoroughly documented, well-written and highly optimized code base with references to the scientific papers it is based on.</b></p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="start"></a>
Getting Started</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drag the prefab "Time of Day/Prefabs/Sky Dome" into your scene</li>
<li>Add the Time of Day camera script to your main camera (Component -&gt; Time of Day -&gt; Camera Main Script)</li>
<li>Add any of the optional camera scripts to your main camera (Component -&gt; Time of Day -&gt; ...)</li>
<li>Enable or disable any child objects of the sky dome you do or don't want to use</li>
<li>Tweak the sky dome inspector variables until you are satisfied with the result</li>
</ol>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The camera script moves the sky dome directly before clipping the scene, guaranteeing that all other position updates have been processed. You should not move the sky dome in "LateUpdate" because this can cause minor differences in the sky dome position between frames when moving the camera.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="time"></a>
Day &amp; Night Cycle</h1>
<p>The script <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html" title="Time iteration class. ">TOD_Time</a> manages the dynamic day &amp; night cycle.</p>
<p>The following parameters are being set by <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html" title="Time iteration class. ">TOD_Time</a>:</p><ul>
<li>TOD_Sky.Cycle.Hour</li>
<li>TOD_Sky.Cycle.Day</li>
<li>TOD_Sky.Cycle.Month</li>
<li>TOD_Sky.Cycle.Year</li>
</ul>
<p>It also offers a time curve that can be modified via the Unity inspector to speed up or slow down certain parts of the day-night cycle. The X axis of the graph denotes the current time, which always progresses linearly. The Y axis of the graph denotes the time that is being set in the sky dome and is therefore visible to the player. That means the higher the inclination of the curve the faster this certain part of the day passes by.</p>
<p>The following events are fired by <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html" title="Time iteration class. ">TOD_Time</a>:</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html#ad9b0360577dff8ad3390933f306de998" title="Fired whenever the minute value is incremented. ">TOD_Time.OnMinute</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html#ae43833071511e44d26ec4028b067df01" title="Fired whenever the hour value is incremented. ">TOD_Time.OnHour</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html#a82df700ebb1b83951bb4fbde42929a35" title="Fired whenever the day value is incremented. ">TOD_Time.OnDay</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html#a84e4d7b98baffb2e3927c54f243cd05e" title="Fired whenever the month value is incremented. ">TOD_Time.OnMonth</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html#a748366599f8b99539118005a714bf579" title="Fired whenever the year value is incremented. ">TOD_Time.OnYear</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html#aa034b785de6023f53f0d5caf8c25a33e" title="Fired whenever the sun rises. ">TOD_Time.OnSunrise</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___time.html#a6c466251909cb303e029408499e37217" title="Fired whenever the sun sets. ">TOD_Time.OnSunset</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All events can be subscribed to by adding a void method with no arguments via the += operator. Note that all events are only fired once per frame, which means that even if more than one minute passes in a single frame, any methods that are subscribed to OnMinute will still only be called once.</p>

 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="upgrade"></a>
Upgrade Guide</h1>
<p>Doing a basic upgrade: (only recommended for minor releases as this does not delete or rename files)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the current set of parameters using the export function in the context menu of the <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html" title="Main sky dome management class. ">TOD_Sky</a> script</li>
<li>Import the new version of Time of Day from the Asset Store</li>
<li>Check the <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html" title="Main sky dome management class. ">TOD_Sky</a> script on your prefab to see if there are any setup issues that have to be addressed</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing a full reimport: (recommended for major releases or if the basic upgrade was unsuccessful)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the current set of parameters using the export function in the context menu of the <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html" title="Main sky dome management class. ">TOD_Sky</a> script</li>
<li>Remove the old version of Time of Day from your project</li>
<li>Restart Unity</li>
<li>Import the new version of Time of Day from the Asset Store</li>
<li>Check the <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html" title="Main sky dome management class. ">TOD_Sky</a> script on your prefab to see if there are any setup issues that have to be addressed</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="clouds"></a>
Clouds</h1>
<p>Time of Day supports dynamic volumetric cloud layers and handmade cloud billboards.</p>
<p>Cloud billboards can be customized to fit the specific art style of a project. This includes the individual billboard instances, positions, textures and meshes - just have a look at the "Billboards" child object of the sky dome.</p>
<p>Cloud layers are volumetric and their density is traced using a combination of noise octaves from the RGBA channels of a lookup textures. Both coverage and shading can be dynamically adjusted to fit any scenario.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="location"></a>
Time Zone &amp; Location Coordinates</h1>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html#af504fd31153c4f7f17f4d9c6438abff2" title="Parameters of the world. ">TOD_Sky.World</a> and <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html#a9eaad877407a18f8214e80ac4362dd14" title="Parameters of the day and night cycle. ">TOD_Sky.Cycle</a> parameter sections allow for configuration of the sky dome to simulate the exact earth, sun and moon movement for any location on the planet depending on Gregorian date, UTC/GMT time zone and geographic coordinates. This for example allows to recreate eclipses just as they would occur in real life.</p>
<p>It is important to manually set the correct time zone offset (TOD_Sky.World.UTC) that fits the longitude and latitude parameters in order to use local time instead of UTC.</p>
<p>All of those parameters are completely optional - if the sky dome should be used in a generic fantasy world they can simply be ignored and left at their default values.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ambient"></a>
Ambient Light &amp; Reflections</h1>
<p>Unity 5 introduced new ways to approximate ambient light and reflections. For a primer on the new features, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoXb-f_pNag">Unite 2014 talk</a>.</p>
<p>Time of Day offers full support for Unity 5 image-based ambient light and reflections. It can update both the per-scene ambient light and a realtime reflection probe at runtime. Ambient light can be disabled (i.e. not managed by Time of Day), a solid color, a gradient or spherical harmonics. Reflections can be disabled (i.e. not managed by Time of Day) or a cubemap. Both ambient light and reflections contain approximations of the atmosphere in the top half and lerp to the configured ambient light color towards the bottom half. This means the ambient light color set on the Time of Day prefab can be looked at as the ground color of the scene in those cases.</p>
<p>Time of Day also allows you to include some or all layers of your scene in the reflection probe bake process. This should be used with care since updating a reflection probe with various reflected objects is an expensive operation. For most scenes it should be fine to only render the sky dome to the realtime reflection probe by using "Skybox" clear flags and a "Nothing" culling mask.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="effects"></a>
Image Effects</h1>
<p>Time of Day comes with a number of optional image effects.</p>
<p>God Rays:</p><ul>
<li>Added via "Components -&gt; Time of Day -&gt; Camera God Rays"</li>
<li>Adds god rays to sun and moon in a single pass</li>
<li>Correctly interacts with clouds</li>
<li>Ray color is managed by <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html" title="Main sky dome management class. ">TOD_Sky</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Atmospheric Scattering:</p><ul>
<li>Added via "Components -&gt; Time of Day -&gt; Camera Atmospheric Scattering"</li>
<li>Calculates atmospheric sky color and fog-like aerial perspective in a single pass</li>
<li>Requires Unity 5 and shader model 3.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud Shadows:</p><ul>
<li>Added via "Components -&gt; Time of Day -&gt; Camera Cloud Shadows"</li>
<li>Adds cloud shadows to all opaque objects in the scene</li>
<li>Utilizes cutoff and fadeout parameters to prevent adding cloud shadows to shadowed areas</li>
<li>Requires Unity 5</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="quality"></a>
Rendering Quality</h1>
<p>For the best visual quality it is recommended to use Time of Day with the following setup:</p><ul>
<li>Linear color space selected in the project player settings</li>
<li>HDR enabled on the main camera</li>
<li>The following image effects (in this order)<ol type="1">
<li>"Image Effects -&gt; Bloom and Glow -&gt; Bloom" or "SE Natural Bloom &amp; Dirty Lens" from the Asset Store</li>
<li>"Image Effects -&gt; Color Adjustments -&gt; Tonemapping" or "Filmic Tonemapping DELUXE" from the Asset Store</li>
<li>"Image Effects -&gt; Color Adjustments -&gt; Color Correction" or "Amplify Color" from the Asset Store</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="performance"></a>
Performance Remarks</h1>
<p>Desktop:</p><ul>
<li>The size of a web player with just the sky dome is only around 200KB as most equations are evaluated dynamically</li>
<li>All scripts and shaders are highly optimized and will not have a significant FPS impact on desktop computers</li>
<li>Realtime reflections that include objects other than the sky dome can be expensive and should be used with care</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile:</p><ul>
<li>Older mobile devices should choose quality settings that offer suitable performance</li>
<li>Lower star qualities significantly reduce the overall vertex count</li>
<li>Lower cloud qualities significantly reduce the complexity of the per-pixel calculations</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="rendering"></a>
Rendering Order</h1>
<p>The rendering order of the sky dome components is the following:</p><ul>
<li>Unity depth pass</li>
<li>Unity objects (background)</li>
<li>Space</li>
<li>Stars</li>
<li>Sun</li>
<li>Moon</li>
<li>Atmosphere</li>
<li>Unity objects (opaque)</li>
<li>Unity image effects (depth)</li>
<li>Clear</li>
<li>Clouds</li>
<li>Billboards</li>
<li>Unity objects (transparent)</li>
<li>Unity image effects (remaining)</li>
</ul>
<p>This usually leads to 3-6 draw calls to render the complete sky dome, depending on the scene setup. All billboards can be dynamically batched on Unity Pro.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="shaders"></a>
Custom Shaders</h1>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html" title="Main sky dome management class. ">TOD_Sky</a> script sets some global shader parameters that can be used in your custom shaders. For a complete list see the TOD_Base.cginc file. Any of those variables can be used in any shader by simply defining uniform variables with the same name, which will then automatically be set to the most recent values every frame. It is also possible to simply include TOD_Base.cginc to get access to all variables.</p>
<p>In addition to those base variables there is also TOD_Scattering.cginc, which offers functions to easily evaluate the scattering equations in custom shaders.</p>
<p>The file TOD_Clouds.cginc contains cloud-related functions to render cloud layers and cloud shadows.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="networking"></a>
Networking</h1>
<ul>
<li>To network date and time, synchronize the property TOD_Sky.Cycle.Ticks of type long</li>
<li>To network cloud movement, synchronize the property TOD_Sky.Components.Animation.CloudUV of type Vector3</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="serialization"></a>
Parameter Import &amp; Export</h1>
<p>It is possible to import and export custom presets to XML via the "Import Parameters" and "Export Parameters" options in the context menu of the <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html" title="Main sky dome management class. ">TOD_Sky</a> script. Exported parameters can be imported in other projects or even loaded at runtime by using the appropriate API calls.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="examples"></a>
Example Scripts</h1>
<p>The package comes with various example scripts to demonstrate sky dome integration.</p>
<ul>
<li>AudioAtDay / AudioAtNight / AudioAtTime: Fade audio sources in and out according to a time of day or a specific weather type</li>
<li>ParticleAtDay / ParticleAtNight / ParticleAtTime: Fade particle systems in and out according to a time of day or a specific weather type</li>
<li>LightAtDay / LightAtNight / LightAtTime: Fade light intensities in and out according to a time of day or a specific weather type</li>
<li>RenderAtDay / RenderAtNight / RenderAtWeather: Enable or disable renderer components according to a time of day or a specific weather type</li>
<li>LoadSkyFromFile: Load exported sky dome parameters at runtime from a TextAsset that can be assigned via drag &amp; drop</li>
<li>WeatherManager: Example for a weather manager that integrates with Time of Day and manages particle effects</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="faq"></a>
Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Q: How can I get a sky dome (<a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html" title="Main sky dome management class. ">TOD_Sky</a>) reference in my custom scripts?</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html#a4bd1c116b487645aa79223d959614474" title="The most recently created sky dome instance. ">TOD_Sky.Instance</a> keeps a static reference to the most recent sky dome that has been instantiated.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___sky.html#a5054e3c6104ec2e9eae62213474f6b51" title="All currently active sky dome instances. ">TOD_Sky.Instances</a> keeps a static list of referenes to all sky domes that have been instantiated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How can I use the sky dome with virtual reality devices like the Oculus Rift?</p><ul>
<li>Add the <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___camera.html" title="Sky dome management camera component. ">TOD_Camera</a> script to one of the cameras (preferably the one that's being rendered first).</li>
<li>The sky will render correctly without artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How can I render a cubemap or custom skybox at night?</p><ul>
<li>Make sure the "Space" child object is enabled.</li>
<li>Assign your cubemap to the "Space" material and adjust the brightness parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How can I add the clouds, sun, moon, or stars to reflections?</p><ul>
<li>Put any game objects you want to show up in reflections on a separate layer.</li>
<li>Add that layer to the Reflection.CullingMask variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How can I align the sky dome geographic directions with those of my scene?</p><ul>
<li>Rotate the sky dome around the y-axis such that the sun rises in the east of your scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How can I adjust the color of the sky around sunrise and sunset?</p><ul>
<li>Use the Day.SkyColor gradient to adjust the base color tint of the sky at different times of day.</li>
<li>The left end of the gradient is used around noon.</li>
<li>The right end of the gradient is used around sunrise and sunset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: My terrain or object lighting looks incorrect when the time of day changes.</p><ul>
<li>Make sure that static lightmapping is disabled when using a dynamic day / night cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: My shadows are flickering when the time of day changes.</p><ul>
<li>This is a limitation of shadow maps in general, but there are ways to counteract.</li>
<li>Shadow quality depends on the shadow resolution, shadow distance and shadow cascade quality settings.</li>
<li>Shadow flickering is caused by light source movement and amplified by huge draw distances or low qualities.</li>
<li>Increasing Light.UpdateInterval moves the light source less frequently and therefore reduces flickering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How can I get the god rays (<a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___rays.html" title="God ray camera component. ">TOD_Rays</a>) to consider or ignore a certain object?</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___rays.html" title="God ray camera component. ">TOD_Rays</a> uses the depth buffer and color buffer alpha values to block light.</li>
<li>Objects that should block god rays have to either write to depth or write a valid alpha value.</li>
<li>Objects that should not block god rays have to use the "ZWrite Off" and "ColorMask RGB" shader features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How can I disable some part of the sky dome?</p><ul>
<li>Disable any child game object to keep that specific part of the sky dome from rendering.</li>
<li>You can also disable any script on the parent game object individually to disable that specific functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: I see black lines around objects when using anti-aliasing in forward rendering.</p><ul>
<li>Disable the "Single Pass" flag on the <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___scattering.html" title="Atmospheric scattering and aerial perspective camera component. ">TOD_Scattering</a> image effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: My water reflections are missing the sky dome even though its layer is included.</p><ul>
<li>Disable the "Single Pass" flag on the <a class="el" href="class_t_o_d___scattering.html" title="Atmospheric scattering and aerial perspective camera component. ">TOD_Scattering</a> image effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Always disable entire child objects rather than their individual components since the enabled states of components are being modified by the sky dome scripts, which can override your changes.</p>
<p><br />
